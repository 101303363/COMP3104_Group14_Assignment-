•DevOps is a new term emerging from the collision of two major related trends. The first was also called “agile infrastructure” or “agile operations”. it sprang from applying Agile and Lean 
approaches to operations work

•DevOps is “a cross-disciplinary community of practice dedicated to the study of building, evolving and operating rapidly-changing resilient systems at scale.” - Jez Humble

• DevOps is a combination of software development and information technology operations that enables businesses to deliver applications at a faster pace. It brings together development and
